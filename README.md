a clean, simple multilayer perceptron network made from scratch that features save/load model capability and momentum stochastic gradient descent training. currently just classifies mnist digits but any other dataset can be loaded

mostly explanatory as this process helped me learn ML
useful formulas written out nicely in markdown using LaTeX typesetting

datasets can be found here
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
and should be dropped into the 'database' folder

if you want to utilize the save/load functionality, create an empty 'models' folder

have fun
